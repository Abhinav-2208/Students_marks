# Students Mark Predictor Using Simple linear Regression
### Simple Linear Regression
Simple linear regression is a statistical technique used to model the relationship between two variables: a dependent variable (also known as the response variable) and an independent variable (also known as the predictor variable). It assumes a linear relationship between the two variables, which means that the dependent variable can be approximated by a straight line when plotted against the independent variable.

In simple linear regression, the goal is to find the best-fitting line that minimizes the differences between the observed data points and the predicted values on the line. The equation of a simple linear regression model is typically represented as:

### Equation of Line :
y = β0 + β1x + ε
<br>
#### Where :
<ul>
<li>y represents the dependent variable</li>
<li>x represents the independent variable</li>
<li>β0 is the intercept (the value of y when x is zero)</li>
<li>β1 is the slope (the change in y for a unit change in x), and</li>
<li>ε represents the error term, which accounts for the discrepancy between the predicted and observed values.</li>
</ul>
